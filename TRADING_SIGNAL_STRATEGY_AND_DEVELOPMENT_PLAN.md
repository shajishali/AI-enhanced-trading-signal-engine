## Trading Signal Generation Strategy & Development Plan

This document explains the trading strategy logic and the phased development plan for the signal generation system.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Trading Strategy Logic

Our signal generation is based on multi-timeframe technical analysis, combined with indicator confirmations and fundamental news sentiment.

#### Step 1 â€“ Market Context

- Higher timeframe trend detection (1D):
  - Identify if the market is trending up or down.
  - Mark key support and supply zones on 1D and 4H charts.

#### Step 2 â€“ Market Structure

- On the 4H timeframe, look for CHoCH (Change of Character) to detect a possible trend reversal.
- After CHoCH, wait for the first BOS (Break of Structure) in the new direction (uptrend or downtrend).
- Move down to the 1H timeframe: confirm a second BOS for entry precision.

#### Step 3 â€“ Entry Confirmation (Lower Timeframes)

- On 1H and 15M charts, confirm with:
  1. Candlestick pattern: Bullish engulfing (for longs) or bearish engulfing (for shorts).
  2. RSI: For long entries, RSI should be between 20â€“50 (showing pullback zone in an uptrend).
  3. MACD: Look for bullish or bearish crossovers and alignment with SMA/EMA trend.
  4. Pivot Points: Entry must align with pivot-based support/resistance levels.

#### Step 4 â€“ Risk Management

- Place Stop Loss just beyond the nearest key level (swing high/low or pivot).
- Define Take Profit targets at higher key levels (next resistance/support).
- Use a trailing stop-loss to lock profits as price moves favorably.

#### Step 5 â€“ Fundamental Confirmation

- Continuously monitor high-impact crypto/financial news (e.g., via APIs similar to Forex Factory).
- Avoid entries during major negative news; increase confidence when sentiment is strongly positive.

âœ… This ensures trades are aligned with market trend, structure, technical confirmations, and real-time fundamentals.

### ðŸ”¹ Development Phases

#### Phase 1 â€“ Rule-Based Strategy Engine (Baseline Signals)

- Code all rules directly (trend, BOS/CHoCH, RSI, MACD, pivots, candlesticks).
- Use pandas-ta / TA-Lib for indicator calculations.
- Fetch OHLCV via CCXT and store in database.
- Implement StrategyEngine to evaluate rules â†’ output signals (BUY / SELL / HOLD).
- Save signals in DB and expose via Django REST API/WebSocket.

Deliverable: Automated baseline signals per coin and timeframe.

---

#### Phase 2 â€“ Logging & Backtesting

- Add TradeLog model to store entries, exits, SL/TP, outcomes.
- Use Backtesting.py or Backtrader for historical simulations.
- Generate key metrics:
  - Win rate, Sharpe ratio, profit factor, drawdown.
- Build Django dashboard for performance visualization.

Deliverable: Validated strategy with transparent performance stats.

---

#### Phase 3 â€“ Machine Learning Integration

- Collect extended data: OHLCV, indicators, sentiment scores from news (e.g., FinBERT).
- Train models:
  - XGBoost/LightGBM for structured features.
  - LSTM/GRU for sequential time-series patterns.
- Label data with Buy/Sell/Hold or next % change.
- Validate using walk-forward testing to prevent overfitting.
- Deploy trained models in Django for live inference.

Deliverable: ML-based predictive layer to enhance signals.

---

#### Phase 4 â€“ Hybrid System (Rules + AI)

- Fuse rule engine and ML confidence:
  - Example: Confirm Buy only if both the rule engine and ML model agree.
  - Adjust position size based on ML probability (e.g., higher confidence = larger position).
- Retrain ML models periodically with new data.
- Subscription tiers:
  - Basic â†’ Rule-based signals.
  - Premium â†’ Hybrid AI-enhanced signals.
- Deliver signals via API, dashboard, or alerts (Telegram/Email/WebSocket).

Deliverable: High-accuracy adaptive signal service with monetization model.
