- **üõ°Ô∏è STOP_LOSS_HIT**: Signal hit 40% stop loss

### **Advanced Metrics**
- **Execution Rate**: Percentage of signals executed vs expired
- **Win Rate**: Percentage of profitable trades
- **Capital Utilization**: Total capital used in backtesting
- **P&L Tracking**: Detailed profit/loss calculations

---

## üéØ **EXACT IMPLEMENTATION OF YOUR REQUIREMENTS**

### **Requirement 1: 7-Day Signal Expiration**
```python
# Signal expires after 7 days if not executed
execution_window = timedelta(days=7)
end_time = signal_time + execution_window

# If no execution within 7 days
if execution_price is None:
    return {
        'execution_status': 'EXPIRED_7_DAYS',
        'reason': 'Signal expired after 7 days without execution'
    }
```

### **Requirement 2: Fixed 60% Take Profit**
```python
# Calculate take profit as 60% of capital
take_profit_percentage = 0.60  # 60%

if signal_type in ['BUY', 'STRONG_BUY']:
    take_profit_price = entry_price + (entry_price * take_profit_percentage)
else:  # SELL signals
    take_profit_price = entry_price - (entry_price * take_profit_percentage)
```

### **Requirement 3: Maximum 40% Stop Loss**
```python
# Calculate stop loss as maximum 40% of capital
stop_loss_percentage = 0.40  # 40%

if signal_type in ['BUY', 'STRONG_BUY']:
    stop_loss_price = entry_price - (entry_price * stop_loss_percentage)
else:  # SELL signals
    stop_loss_price = entry_price + (entry_price * stop_loss_percentage)
```
