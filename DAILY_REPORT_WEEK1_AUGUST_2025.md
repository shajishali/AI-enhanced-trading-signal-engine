## Weekly Reflection:

**What went well this week?**
The project setup went smoothly, and I was able to establish a solid foundation for the AI Trading Engine. Creating the database models helped me understand the domain requirements better, and Django's ORM proved to be intuitive for financial data modeling. The authentication system implementation was straightforward, and the API development with Django REST Framework was more efficient than expected.

**What could be improved?**
I should have spent more time planning the database schema before implementation. Also, I should have set up testing infrastructure from the beginning to ensure code quality. The frontend integration could have been more systematic, and I should have implemented proper error handling earlier in the development process.

**How did this week contribute to the overall project goals?**
This week established the foundation for the entire project. The database models will be the backbone of all future features, and the project structure will support scalable development. The authentication system provides security for the application, and the API architecture enables flexible frontend development.

**Key Learnings:**
- Django's model system is excellent for financial data modeling
- API-first development approach provides better flexibility
- Comprehensive testing from the start prevents many issues
- Proper project structure is crucial for maintainability
- Documentation and code comments are essential for team collaboration
