WORKING SOLUTION FOR ALL 5 SIGNAL GENERATION ISSUES
==================================================

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
- Celery workers not running (Issue #1)
- Missing market data for major symbols (Issue #2) 
- All symbols are active (Issue #3 - SOLVED)
- Technical indicators exist (Issue #4 - SOLVED)
- High confidence thresholds (Issue #5 - SOLVED)

IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:
=========================

STEP 1: START CELERY WORKERS (CRITICAL)
---------------------------------------
Open TWO command prompt windows and run:

Terminal 1:
start_celery_worker.bat

Terminal 2: 
start_celery_beat.bat

Keep both terminals running - this enables automatic signal generation every hour.

STEP 2: UPDATE MARKET DATA (CRITICAL)
------------------------------------
Run these commands in a new terminal:

python manage.py shell

Then execute:
from apps.data.tasks import update_crypto_prices
update_crypto_prices()

Wait for completion, then verify:
MarketData.objects.filter(symbol__symbol='BTCUSDT').count()

STEP 3: TEST SIGNAL GENERATION
------------------------------
python manage.py shell

Then execute:
from apps.signals.services import SignalGenerationService
from apps.trading.models import Symbol
service = SignalGenerationService()
symbol = Symbol.objects.get(symbol='ETHUSDT')
signals = service.generate_signals_for_symbol(symbol)
print(f"Generated {len(signals)} signals")

STEP 4: VERIFY AUTOMATIC GENERATION
-----------------------------------
Check active signals:
TradingSignal.objects.filter(is_valid=True).count()

Wait 1 hour and check again - new signals should appear automatically.

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
================
- Celery workers running without errors
- Market data exists for BTCUSDT/ETHUSDT
- Signals generated when testing manually
- New signals appear every hour automatically
- Active signals count increases over time

TROUBLESHOOTING:
===============
If Celery fails:
- Check Redis is running: redis-cli ping
- Install Redis if needed
- Restart Celery workers

If market data missing:
- Check internet connection
- Verify API configuration
- Try different symbols

If no signals generated:
- Check Celery worker logs
- Verify market data exists
- Check technical indicators calculated
- Lower thresholds further if needed

FINAL NOTES:
===========
- Keep Celery workers running 24/7
- Market data updates every 5 minutes
- Signals generated every hour automatically
- Monitor logs for any issues
- System will work automatically once Celery is running
