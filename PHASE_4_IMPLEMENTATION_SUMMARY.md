### 7. Dashboard Views
- **Hybrid Dashboard** (`/signals/hybrid/`)
  - Subscription status and usage overview
  - Recent hybrid signals display
  - Symbol-specific signal summaries
  - Usage statistics and limits

## üß™ Test Results
**Phase 4 Test Suite Results: 12/16 tests passed (75% success rate)**
